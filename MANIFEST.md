## Who I Am

I'm a criminologist from Australia. I've spent years studying why our systems don't work — justice, governance, safety. I've also experienced the failures personally (every crime I'm about to discuss, I've been on the receiving end of, except murder, though close enough).

I'm posting this because ideas shouldn't die with people. If something happens to me, maybe someone else can build it.

## Why This Exists

Voting every few years is ridiculous — the idea that it's difficult or impossible to implement better is ridiculous. Facebook has secure online voting every week if required. AU govt can't do it but a pointless social media can?

Politicians do nothing valuable. They abuse each other and are experts in nothing. If we want a road we need a civil engineer not a lawyer.

Lords vs Plebs still exist and our current system is still aligned to laws made 2000 years ago to benefit land owning lords. Who are still our leaders from a system baked in racism. There are still 92 hereditary MPs who ultimately govern AU.

For the record, I have hereditary benefit — so I know that I ultimately will be disadvantaged by my own recommended system.

### The Insanity

- **Basic human rights**: Drug laws barbaric and racist. Incarceration barbaric. McDonalds the cheapest food insanity.
- **Logic denied completely**: The system doesn't work. 45% recidivism is an accepted norm. Drugs can be obtained within 30 minutes despite criminality.
- **Expense**: $400/day to kidnap people and force them into inhuman conditions.

It would be cheaper to house our prison population in 5 star hotels with butlers. The current system results in what it's meant to reduce 45% of the time. I bet the 5 star hotel with butler system would be more effective at achieving a reduction of crime, as well as being cheaper.

### Bullshit Work

The current system has humans working 40 hours per week. While research and COVID have indicated about 50% of that work is bullshit. So 20 hours per week individuals are spending "keeping up appearances pretending" at work while our kids don't have their mum and dad there. And it achieves nothing. For anybody.

Why would we do this to ourselves?

This system is insane. A mad hatter's tea party.

### We Tolerate Monstrosity When It Is Slow and Profitable

Take cancerous food products. Bacon. Yep. It's the same cancer rating as cigarettes. No warning labels. Permitted.

Mushroom lady poisons her family — locked away for life. I'm not saying she shouldn't be necessarily, but the disparity between a business allowed to poison us for profit and a person being locked in jail for the same crime is unsettling.

### Poisons Like Alcohol

- The only edible product not required to have a nutrition label? Alcohol.
- The only drug you can die of withdrawals from? Alcohol.

GHB on the other hand, similar in effect, yet you'll be kidnapped and thrown in jail if you have even 1 dose of it for your own personal use.

- GHB has been shown in research to prevent Alzheimer's
- GHB is the only sleeping aid that produces healthy sleep and delta brain waves
- GHB increases HGH
- GHB is the only recreational drug bodybuilders would touch because of health benefit and lack of detriments

It makes no sense.

### Drug Pushers?

McDonalds manager. Pillar of the community. 2.5 million happy meals sold every day to kids starting them on a pathway of dependence and negative health consequences.

MDMA dealer — criminal. If caught could be imprisoned for 10 years for having as little as 10g (half the weight of a stick of gum). MDMA is arguably healthier, less addictive, more beneficial in terms of psychological potential.

Why? It is senseless.

Do you remember in the 30s when alcohol was criminalised? What happened? Everybody drank more.

## Why I Care (And Why You Should)

There are people who have less than me who are being persecuted more than me. Who are a part of my experience of the world emotionally. They exist. And even if I ignore it. They exist. And even if I avoid it, they exist.

There is so much pain every day.

I am a criminologist and a counselor. I've worked in victim support. I couldn't believe the sheer number of violent crimes that occur every day. You wouldn't hear about it. There's no real record of it. Yet it exists. It is life ruining. It destroys us.

We do not have the convenience of the past where we were unaware, uneducated, silenced by power limits. Today, we each own our personal phone or PC or both. We have access to the whole world in our pocket.

I know there is a problem. Any reasonable person can conclude from the evidence this is the case. I don't have the luxury of an excuse like my forefathers.

So I know there is a problem. I have the means to solve it. Therefore, it is my duty to do so.

I don't know many things, but I know a little about system design.

So here we are. Writing.

## Introduction

Modern democratic governance is behaving like a system that hasn't updated since dial-up internet. We vote once every few years, then hand over decision-making to a small group of professional politicians who spend much of their time performing conflict, managing optics, and negotiating party advantage.

Do humans need lawyers verbally abusing each other in a green-chaired room to survive?

Meanwhile, the problems that actually shape human lives (housing, health, education, safety, justice, climate resilience, cost of living) require continuous feedback, domain expertise, and fast iteration.

In most other areas of society, we've already accepted this as normal: we update software weekly, we route traffic in real time, we coordinate entire communities instantly. Yet our public decision-making system still runs on a cycle designed for horse-and-carriage logistics.

### The Real Problem

This paper begins with a simple claim: the problem is not that people are apathetic or "don't care about politics."

The problem is that the governance interface is outdated, distorted, and structurally misaligned with human wellbeing.

The current model:
- Makes it difficult to express nuanced public preferences
- Rewards rhetorical skill over practical competence
- Incentivises short-term theatre instead of long-term outcomes
- Asks citizens to compress complex moral and economic choices into a single ballot
- Treats the result as a blank cheque for years

That is not informed consent. It is periodic delegation.

### The Myth of Impossibility

A common defence of the status quo is that more participatory governance is impossible to implement securely or at scale.

This claim no longer survives contact with reality.

Billions of people coordinate identity, access, money, and reputation through digital systems every day. If modern platforms can authenticate users, prevent abuse, and manage large-scale trust relationships in real time, then a society can design democratic tools that are similarly robust.

The real barrier is not technology in principle, but institutional inertia: the system protects itself by framing reform as unrealistic.

### Where The Dysfunction Shows Up

**Justice system**: Punishment is routinely treated as a substitute for prevention. High rates of reoffending are normalised as if failure is acceptable when it is slow, bureaucratic, and expensive.

**Drug policy**: Harm is often created by enforcement rather than reduced by care.

**Incarceration**: Practices prioritise control over rehabilitation, despite the moral and financial burden of maintaining conditions that many citizens would not tolerate for themselves.

**Regulatory inconsistency**: Certain harms are culturally tolerated and commercially protected while other behaviours are criminalised with severe penalties, even when the public health logic is contested or uneven.

The result is a governance culture that can feel less like rational stewardship and more like a prolonged, profitable ritual: a "Mad Hatter's tea party" of rules, exemptions, moral panics, and selective outrage.

### Labour and Time

Modern research and lived experience increasingly point to a painful truth: a significant portion of full-time work exists to maintain appearances and organisational momentum rather than to produce meaningful outcomes.

Many families experience chronic absence of time, presence, and energy not because all labour is essential, but because our economic machine has not been redesigned around human flourishing.

We are running a system that extracts attention and life-hours, while insisting this exhaustion is "normal," even as communities fracture and mental health deteriorates.

### Why Does Any Of This Warrant Solving?

Because the suffering is not hypothetical.

Violence, exploitation, addiction, poverty, and social exclusion are not rare anomalies; they are daily realities. Many of them remain unseen not because they do not exist, but because they are dispersed across private spaces and bureaucratic silence.

As a criminologist and counsellor with experience in victim support, I have encountered the scale of harm that never becomes public narrative. It is life-altering. It is often preventable. And it is the predictable output of a system that treats human breakdown as a downstream "issue" rather than an upstream design failure.

### We No Longer Have The Convenience Of Historical Ignorance

In the past, one could plausibly claim they did not know.

Today, most people carry a device that can access the entire world's evidence, arguments, and data. We are informed enough to notice contradictions, connected enough to witness harm beyond our suburb, and resourced enough (collectively) to build better mechanisms.

Once a society can see a structural problem clearly, refusing to redesign it becomes a choice.

### The Purpose Of This Paper

To argue that governance itself must be redesigned as a continuously updating civic protocol, not a periodic contest between personalities.

The task is not to "improve politicians," but to reduce our dependence on political performance by building systems that:

1. Capture public preferences with more fidelity than an election every few years
2. Elevate domain expertise where expertise is required
3. Measure success by outcomes rather than ideology
4. Treat care, prevention, and human dignity as the baseline — not the reward

This is not utopianism. It is basic systems engineering applied to the machinery that determines whether people live safely, freely, and well.

If we can design complex digital ecosystems for commerce, communication, and coordination, then we can design a civic ecosystem that is less cruel, less wasteful, and more intelligently aligned with what humans actually need.

I do not claim to know everything required to build such a system. But I do know enough to recognise a solvable problem, and I know enough about digital design to sketch a credible alternative.

That is where this paper begins.

## THE PROBLEM

**Skip to [THE SOLUTION](#the-solution) if you don't care about the reasoning.**

Every system we have shares one flaw: **the people making decisions are insulated from the consequences.**

- Politicians vote on laws affecting communities they've never visited
- Judges sentence people to conditions they've never experienced
- Police "protect" people they don't know and aren't accountable to

### The Results

| Domain | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Justice** | Australia spends $400/day per prisoner. 45% recidivism. We pay to make people worse. |
| **Safety** | Average police response time is 20+ minutes. DV victims are told to call a number that takes forever while someone's beating them. |
| **Governance** | Lawyers decide things engineers should decide. Politicians represent donors, not people. |
| **Poverty** | Australia has $20 trillion in national wealth. That's $700,000 per person. Yet 1 in 6 children live in poverty. |
| **Work** | We work 40 hours per weeek and 50% of work is bullsh*t. |

None of this is necessary. It's chosen.

### Example: Bradley Edwards

Bradley Edwards (Claremont serial killer). His first known offense — he grabbed a woman at work, dragged her to a bathroom, held her, looked her in the eyes, shook his head, and let her go. Classic rehearsal behavior.

What happened?
- Charged with common assault
- Kept his job

Next victim: tied up, raped at a cemetery, let go.

Then: three women murdered.

**The system designed to keep us safe had him. And released him. With zero victim involvement, zero community visibility, zero empathy process.**

That's not a flaw in the system. That's the system working exactly as designed — protecting insiders from consequences while ignoring everyone else. Now we lock him in a box forever when it could have been prevented. His being there does nothing for victims. Millions spent on his arrest, investigation, trial. It is STILL costing us - and him. And the families. And his family. The costs are unquantifyable. If you have lolst somebody. You know. 

To quote Tariq Azim "There are victims on both sides of the gun". Tariq's son was murdered delevering pizza in a gang initiation known as 'jacking the pizza boy'. The murderer was a child. Tariq created a foundation to teach about peace and its value. Tariq befriended the shooters grandfather. He offered a job to his son's murderer if he wanted it.He turned something unimaginable. If you haven't lost a child - then you do not know. He turned it into something aimed at preventing something like this ever happening again. They are big shoes to fill. And I try.  

### Bullshit Work

Modern research and lived experience increasingly point to a painful truth: a significant portion of full-time work exists to maintain appearances and organisational momentum rather than to produce meaningful outcomes.

Many families experience chronic absence of time, presence, and energy not because all labour is essential, but because our economic machine has not been redesigned around human flourishing.

We are running a system that extracts attention and life-hours, while insisting this exhaustion is "normal," even as communities fracture and mental health deteriorates.

## THE INSIGHT

You can't fix these problems one by one. You have to change **the conditions under which decisions get made**.

If the people deciding things had to live with the consequences — actually live them — they'd decide differently.

- You can't vote to lock people in cages if you've lived their life for a week.
- You can't dismiss someone's housing crisis if you've slept in their situation.
- You can't ignore DV if the person being beaten is someone whose life you've experienced firsthand.

**The problem isn't bad people. The problem is insulation from consequences.**

Remove the insulation, and the problems solve themselves.

---

## THE SOLUTION

None of us have the freedom of a lack of means. You have the power right now at your fingertips to change the whole world.

It's not a policy. It's a process. It takes 5 minutes to join. Everything else flows from iteration.

### The Components

#### 1. The Token

One token per human. Not a cryptocurrency — you can't trade it, it has no monetary value. It's proof you exist and were verified by other humans.

**How you get one:**
- 3 existing token holders vouch for you
- You all meet in person (physically verified via phones/mesh network)
- They sign, you're in
- Takes 5 minutes

**Why it works:**
- Can't fake being in the same room as 3 real people at scale (sybil-resistant)
- No government ID required (stateless people can join)
- No corporation controls it (decentralized)

**Technical:** Anchored to Bitcoin for permanence (can't be erased), stored on distributed network (IPFS), works offline via mesh (Yggdrasil, ET, Mosh, QUIC, tmux, etc).

#### 2. The Ring

$9 NFC smart ring. No battery, no charging, waterproof. Contains pointer to your token.

You can find it on amazon.com.au right now for 9 AUD.

**Functions (all via tapping your phone):**
- Identify yourself
- Vouch for others
- Vote
- Trigger safety alert
- Check into meetings

That's it. The phone does the work. The ring is just a button and a symbol.

#### 3. Proximity-Weighted Voting

Everyone can vote on everything. But your vote is weighted by how close you are to the issue.

- Vote on a speed bump on your street? Full weight.
- Vote on a speed bump 1000km away? Almost no weight.

Proximity = physical distance for local issues, social distance (vouch graph) for broader issues.

**No politicians. No representatives. No lawyers deciding road stuff — civil engineers decide road things. Doctors decide health things. Affected people decide everything.**

#### 4. The Safety Button

Press button (ring tap or app). Your location goes to all token holders within 1km. They respond. **60 seconds, not 20 minutes.**

No cops. Community response. People who actually know you or are willing to help.

Think volunteer firefighters — guys love doing this stuff. It'll be something everybody will want.

I go to anyone I see experiencing DV. I made my friend go outside and sit on the pavement while a couple was arguing nearby. To intervene quickly if it escalated. (I follow Gandhi's thing — give your life non-violently to protect anyone experiencing violence — which I interpreted to mean human-shield it non-confrontationally).

**Research shows safety buttons are the most effective intervention for domestic violence.** We all know instinctually people knowing where you are makes you safer. We're making what we all know works universal.

#### 5. Empathy Invitations

When meetings fail — when people can't agree — they swap lives for 7 days.

Not swap permissions (you don't get all their access to other people's stuff). Swap experience. Live their routine. See their world.

Then reconvene. The answer usually becomes obvious.

**This is the thing that makes it all work. It's what ensures decisions are made by people who understand the consequences.**

#### 6. Transparency by Default

Everyone can see everyone (in the network). You can see me. I can see you. Mutual.

This isn't surveillance — surveillance is when someone watches you and you can't watch back. This is mutual visibility.

Exceptions granted by community when needed (DV survivors hiding from abusers, etc).

**Why it matters:**
- Can't isolate victims (community sees if someone disappears)
- Can't hide abuse patterns
- Accountability is built-in

#### 7. End of Bullshit Work → UBI

When people have real voice, they vote to end pointless jobs and redirect resources to universal basic income.

Research indicates 50% of the work we do is bullshit. COVID's essentiality data further provides us with usable data. I can relate to 50% of the work being BS. Can't you? At my work it's been closer to 80-90%.

If we changed up the system. If we provided UBI and we considered "essentials" as part of that. We split the reward of essential by the number of workers. We could ensure everything is done while simultaneously eliminating our biggest cost. (Time of course being the only true asset).

### The Math

Do you know AU is the second richest country per capita in the world? Do you understand how much money we have?

And yet 1 in 6 children in Australia (according to ads I see at the gym for The Smith Family) is in poverty?

We have like $19 trillion. That is literally enough money to:

- ✅ Pay our government's debt. Every state and federal. **AND**
- ✅ Pay our government's costs. Every state and federal. For FIVE years. **AND**
- ✅ Pay for each of us. All 30ish million. To have a housing asset of $250k. **AND**
- ✅ Pay for each of us to have a business asset of $250k. **AND**
- ✅ Pay each of us a weekly benefit of $800 per week

The math works. We just don't do it because change is hard.

We are keeping a system created 2000 years ago. And we have a choice. We are the people. We can choose differently.

---

## HOW THE SOLUTION ACTUALLY WORKS

1. Person signs up, organizes vouch meet, gets token (5 minutes)
2. Now has rights and obligations as token holder
3. Has problem? Initiates a meeting about it
4. People affected show up (proximity-weighted)
5. Can't agree? Empathy invitation
6. Decisions made by people who have to live with them
7. Iterate until roughly equal and okay

**No politicians. No lawyers deciding things they don't understand. Just people, facing each other, making decisions together.**

## THE TECHNICAL LAYER

Three layers, all using existing technology:

### Layer 1: Bitcoin Anchor

- Epoch roots (state snapshots) anchored to Bitcoin weekly/daily
- Immutable, permanent, can't be erased or disputed
- "This happened" — provable forever

### Layer 2: Human Existence Record (HER)

- Your token identity
- Stored on IPFS (distributed)
- Merkle proofs for verification
- Works offline via "capsule" (QR code with your proof)

### Layer 3: Mesh Network

- Yggdrasil (overlay mesh)
- BATMAN-adv (local WiFi mesh)
- Works without internet
- Devices find each other directly
- Safety alerts route through mesh

### Why It's Unkillable

- No central server to shut down
- No company to sue
- No coin to crash
- Data distributed everywhere
- One surviving node can rebuild

## WHAT ABOUT...

### "What about serial killers?"

The current system HAD Bradley Edwards and failed.

Our system: victim involvement from day one, empathy process, community visibility. For true predators: contained community with dignity, not cage. Still token holders. Still human. Permanent proximity limits.

### "What about privacy?"

You already have none. Corporations track everything and sell it.

This is mutual visibility — you see me, I see you. Equal. Privacy exceptions granted when needed for safety.

### "What about gaming the system?"

- Can't fake being in the same room as 3 people at scale
- Can't brigade votes you're not proximate to
- Graph analysis catches patterns
- Reputation tracks voucher reliability

### "This is utopian nonsense."

Every component exists today:
- Bitcoin (15 years)
- Mesh networking (decades)
- NFC (everywhere)
- IPFS (running now)

The innovation is the combination + the philosophy.

### "People are too selfish."

The evidence:
- a) Suggests humans are benevolent and generally cooperative
- b) Says humans are plastic — systems shape behavior

For evidence, look at these words. What language are they in? How do you know this language? You didn't make it up yourself. You learned it from your experience, surrounding, and connection.

Current system rewards hoarding and isolation. This one rewards connection and accountability. Same humans, different outcomes.

---

## THE HONEST UNCERTAINTIES

I don't have all the answers:

**Bootstrapping:** How do the first 3 people get tokens? Genesis event with documented initial group. Could be corrupted.

**Empathy backfiring:** What if living someone's life makes you hate them more? Research suggests unlikely, but we'll see.

**Emergency speed:** Some things need decisions NOW. Delegate systems with pre-authorized authority? Needs design.

We might be wrong. But the current system is definitely wrong.

No matter who I speak with, the conversation is the same:
- "Yes, there are problems. No I can't solve them because I have no power to solve them."

Once I prove to someone they can solve the problems it becomes:
- "Yes I am powerful enough to solve them, but there is no solution."

So here I am, with a solution. Will it work? Only one way to find out.

---

## WHY I'M POSTING THIS

I've thought about this for years. Tonight it crystallized into something buildable.

I have coders (3-4, security/pen-testing background — perfect for this). I have some resources. I have a pilot community in mind.

But I'm one person with health issues, PTSD, FND, I can't speak most of the time. I have significant limitations. Ideas shouldn't die with people or personal limits.

So here it is. The whole thing.

### If you want to help build it

Comment or DM. I need people who can work on:
- App development (React Native)
- Mesh networking
- Cryptography (BLS signatures, Merkle proofs)
- Community organizing

### If you think it's stupid

Tell me why. I've answered the objections I could think of. Maybe you'll find one I missed.

### If something happens to me

Build it anyway. The technical specs exist. The philosophy is here. The components are all open source. Don't let it die.

To paraphrase Jeffrey Sachs and Marianne Williamson:

> If when we die the world is not at peace, we will be the first generation who could have changed things and didn't.

Live every day for good. With the intention for things to change.

Remember: it is only what you are not giving that can be lacking from any situation.

---

## TL;DR

One token per human. $9 ring. Safety button with 60-second community response. Proximity-weighted voting. Empathy invitations when you can't agree. Transparency so abuse can't hide. Anchored to Bitcoin so it can't be erased. Mesh network so it can't be shut down.

**Changes conditions → changes decisions → changes outcomes.**

5 minutes to join. Iteration until everyone's roughly equal and okay.

The current system costs $32 billion a year to produce 45% recidivism and dead women.

This costs almost nothing and might actually work.

**Let's find out.**
