# Token System — Technical Specification
## Version 0.1 (Pilot)

---

## Overview

A decentralized identity and community response system. One token per human. NFC ring as physical interface. Community-led safety and decision-making.

---

## Core Principles

1. **One token, one human** — No duplicates. Sybil-resistant.
2. **Proximity-based** — Decisions weighted by those closest to the issue.
3. **5-minute solutions** — Joining is fast. The system iterates.
4. **Community response** — Safety is local, not outsourced.

---

## System Components

### 1. The Token (L2 Blockchain)

**Chain:** Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base (TBD — low gas, fast finality)

**Token properties:**
- Non-transferable (soulbound)
- One per wallet
- Wallet tied to verified human
- Contains: creation timestamp, vouch signatures, proximity data

**Smart contract functions:**
```
createToken(voucherSignatures[3], gpsProof, timestamp)
revokeToken(reason, communityVote)
getTokenHolder(address) → tokenData
verifyVouch(tokenAddress, gpsProof) → bool
```

---

### 2. The Vouch Mechanism

**Requirements to create new token:**
- 3 existing token holders
- All 4 people physically present (GPS verified, <10m radius)
- Each voucher signs with their wallet
- Timestamp recorded
- Cannot vouch for same person twice

**Flow:**
1. New user downloads app, creates wallet
2. Finds 3 existing token holders willing to vouch
3. All 4 meet in person
4. Each voucher taps their NFC ring to new user's phone
5. App verifies GPS proximity of all 4 devices
6. App collects 3 signatures
7. Smart contract creates new token
8. New user is now a token holder

**Sybil resistance:**
- Physical presence required
- GPS verification
- Voucher reputation (if your vouched users cause problems, flagged)
- Rate limiting (can only vouch X times per month)

---

### 3. The NFC Ring

**Hardware:** Off-shelf NFC ring (~$2-4 wholesale)

**Contains:**
- NFC chip with wallet address pointer
- No battery, no charging, waterproof

**Functions (all via phone tap):**
1. **Identify** — Prove you're a token holder
2. **Vouch** — Sign vouch transaction for new user
3. **Alert** — Trigger safety alert
4. **Vote** — Cast vote in active polls
5. **Check-in** — Arrive at proximity meeting

---

### 4. The App

**Platform:** iOS and Android (React Native or Flutter)

**Core screens:**

#### Home
- Token status (active/inactive)
- Nearby alerts (if responder)
- Active votes
- Upcoming meetings

#### Alert
- Big red button (backup to ring tap)
- "Hold 3 seconds to confirm"
- Shows: "Alert sent to X responders nearby"
- Live status: "Y responders on way"

#### Vouch
- "I want to vouch for someone" flow
- "I need a token" flow (find nearby holders)
- Vouch history

#### Vote
- Active proposals
- Proximity filter (only see what affects your area)
- Simple yes/no/abstain
- Results transparent and live

#### Meetings
- Upcoming proximity meetings
- Request a meeting (define issue, location, affected radius)
- Meeting history

#### Empathy Invitation
- Request an invitation
- Accept an invitation
- Schedule/coordinate swap
- Log reflections (optional)

### 5. Safety Alert System

**When alert triggered:**

1. **Immediate (0-5 seconds):**
   - GPS captured
   - Alert pushed to all responders within 1km
   - Alert shows: location, token holder name, "HELP REQUESTED"

2. **Responder receives:**
   - Map with location
   - "Accept" button
   - ETA calculator
   - Other responders visible (prevent duplicate response)

3. **Escalation (if no response in 60 seconds):**
   - Expand radius to 2km
   - Notify emergency contacts
   - Optional: notify authorities (user preference)

4. **Resolution:**
   - Alerter marks "safe" or responder marks "resolved"
   - Brief incident log (optional)
   - Responder reputation +1

**Responder requirements:**
- Token holder
- Opted in as responder
- Background check? (community decision)
- Training module completed (in-app, 10 mins)

---

### 6. Voting System

**Proposal creation:**
- Any token holder can create
- Define: issue, affected area (radius), options
- Minimum discussion period before vote opens

**Voting weight:**
- Base: 1 token = 1 vote
- Proximity multiplier: closer to issue = higher weight
- Example: proposal about a park → people within 500m get 2x weight, within 2km get 1.5x, etc.

**Thresholds:**
- Quorum: X% of affected-area token holders must vote
- Pass: Simple majority? Supermajority? (community decision)

**Transparency:**
- All votes public after close
- All proposals archived
- Results immutable on-chain

---

### 7. Proximity Meetings

**Request a meeting:**
- Define issue
- Define location
- App notifies token holders in radius
- Minimum attendees to proceed

**At meeting:**
- Check-in via ring tap (proves attendance)
- Facilitator role (rotating)
- Decisions recorded in app
- Leads to vote if needed

---

### 8. Empathy Invitation

**Request:**
- Token holder requests invitation
- Specifies issue/context
- Matched with willing participant

**Coordination:**
- 7 days scheduled
- Check-ins via app
- Emergency exit option (no penalty)

**Post-invitation:**
- Reflection log (private or shared)
- Meeting scheduled if issue unresolved

**Rules:**
- Swap lives, not permissions
- If you hold someone's stuff, you don't get that stuff
- Purely experiential

---

## Data & Privacy

**On-chain (public):**
- Token existence
- Vouch graph (who vouched whom)
- Vote results
- Meeting attendance (hashes only)

**Off-chain (encrypted, user-controlled):**
- GPS history
- Alert history
- Personal details
- Empathy invitation logs

**User controls:**
- Delete account = burn token
- Export all data
- Granular sharing permissions

---

## Pilot Plan

- Basic app UI

**Phase 2: Safety (Months 2-3)**
- Alert system
- Responder network
- Ring integration (NFC tap)

**Phase 3: Governance (Months 3-4)**
- Voting system
- Meeting coordination
- Proximity weighting

**Phase 4: Empathy (Months 4-5)**
- Empathy invitation flow
- Matching algorithm
- Reflection tools

**Phase 5: Pilot Launch (Month 5-6)**

## Open Questions

1. **Which L2?** — Arbitrum vs Optimism vs Base
2. **Responder vetting?** — How much is enough?
3. **Voting thresholds?** — Simple majority vs supermajority
4. **Escalation to authorities?** — Optional? Never? Always backup?
5. **Pilot location?** — Which community?
6. **Legal structure?** — DAO? Foundation? Co-op?

---

## Budget Estimate (Pilot)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| NFC Rings (100) | $400 |
| App development | Team time (3-4 months) |
| L2 deployment | ~$100 |
| Hosting/infra | ~$50/month |
| Testing/iteration | Ongoing |
| **Total** | **~$1,000 + dev time** |

---

## Success Metrics (Pilot)

- 100 token holders created
- Zero failed vouches
- <60 second average responder acceptance
- >80% votes reach quorum
- >5 proximity meetings held
- >2 empathy invitations completed
- Zero security breaches

---

## Next Steps

1. Confirm L2 choice
2. Confirm pilot community
3. Dev team kickoff
4. Build vouch mechanism first (foundation of everything)
5. Test with team internally before public pilot
