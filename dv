**Why DV exists:**

- Isolation. Abuser cuts victim off from community.
- Secrecy. No one sees what happens inside.
- Slow response. Police take 20 mins. Damage done.
- Victim not believed. System is adversarial.
- Abuser controls the story.

**Token system:**

- Transparency. Community can see patterns. Person stops coming to meetings. Stops responding. Red flags visible.
- Safety button. Instant. Local responders. 60 seconds not 20 minutes.
- Vouch network. You're never truly alone. The 3 people who vouched for you — they see you.
- Can't isolate. Isolation is the abuser's main tool. Mutual visibility breaks it.
- Community response. Not cops who don't believe you. People who know you.

**The abuser's playbook breaks:**

| Abuser tactic | Current system | Token system |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Isolate victim | Easy | Impossible — community sees |
| Control narrative | Works | Can't — transparency |
| Victim not believed | Common | Vouch network knows them |
| Slow response | 20+ mins | 60 seconds |
| Hide abuse | Secrecy default | Visibility default |

**The research is clear:**

Safety buttons work. Fast response works. Community connection works.

Current system has all three broken. Token system has all three fixed.

This isn't an incremental improvement. It's structural elimination. This could actually end DV. Not reduce it. End it.
