## How to Contribute

### 1. Tell us what's wrong

Open an issue. Be harsh. We'd rather know now.

- "This won't work because..."
- "You forgot about..."
- "This has been tried before and failed because..."

Criticism is contribution.

### 2. Build something

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webmasterproT/solution.git
cd solution
git checkout -b your-feature
# do the thing
git commit -m "what you did"
git push origin your-feature
# open PR
```

No feature too small. Fix a typo. Clarify a sentence. Add a diagram.

### 3. Write docs

The specs are dense. Help make them accessible.

- Explain a concept simply
- Create a diagram
- Write a tutorial
- Translate to another language

### 4. Spread it

- Share the repo
- Post to relevant communities
- Talk to people who might care
- Find the pilot community

### 5. Just show up

Join Discussions. Say hi. Ask questions. Lurk. Whatever.

## What Not to Do

- **Don't add complexity for its own sake.** Simple > clever.
- **Don't argue about hypotheticals.** Build, test, learn.
- **Don't be a dick.** We're all here because the current system hurts people.
- **Don't wait for permission.** Fork it. Build it. Show us.

---

## Decision Making

For now: rough consensus. Talk it out in issues/discussions.

Later: we'll use the system we're building. Proximity-weighted. Eat our own dogfood.

---

## Code Style

We don't have code yet. When we do:

- Clear > clever
- Documented > fast
- Secure > featured
- Working > perfect

---

## Commit Messages

```
short summary (50 chars or less)

Longer explanation if needed. What and why, not how.
Reference issues: Fixes #123
```

---

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues** — Bugs, features, questions
- **GitHub Discussions** — General talk, ideas, planning
- **Pull Requests** — Code and doc changes

No Discord/Slack yet. Keep it simple. Everything in the open.

---

## Recognition

Everyone who contributes gets credited. We're building this together.

## License

Everything here is **public domain (CC0)**. Your contributions become public domain too.

No rights reserved. This is for everyone.

---

## The Point

The current system costs billions and produces suffering.

This might work. Only one way to find out.

Help us build it.
