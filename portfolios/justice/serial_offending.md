# The Claremont Killer Case is the edge case people use to defend prisons. It's also the case that proves the current system doesn't keep anyone safe.

Bradley Edwards was convicted of murdering Jane Rimmer and Ciara Glennon. He was acquitted of the murder of Sarah Spiers, who disappeared and has never been found.

For cases like this, the question isn’t “how much punishment” — it’s:

How do we keep everyone safe, especially potential future victims, while refusing to abandon basic human rights?

My best working framework is:

He can’t be unsupervised in the community — not as punishment, as risk reality.

But a system designed to degrade people doesn’t create safety either — it just hides harm behind walls.

So for the 0.1% extreme cases: a contained, supervised living community (not a cage).

permanent proximity limits

structured supervision

therapy, work, stable routines

public accountability and visibility

And crucially: people harmed (and their families) aren’t sidelined. They have real power in shaping the safety plan — within human-rights boundaries.

It doesn’t pretend we can “fix” someone who hunts.
It just chooses reliable safety without revenge architecture.


# Seial Killers

Yeah. That's the edge.

Someone who hunted women for years. Predatory. Pattern. Not situational. Not desperation. Not a relationship gone wrong.

And the honest answer might be: I don't know either.

But maybe the framework is:

**The question isn't "what punishment"** — it's "how do we keep everyone safe, including him, while respecting that he's still human."

Some thoughts:

1. **He can't be unsupervised in the community.** Not as punishment. As reality. The risk is too high.

2. **But a cage that makes him worse isn't safety either.** It's just slow violence we don't have to look at.

3. **What if the "cone" for this edge case is:** a small community of people who live together, supervised, visible, but not a concrete box? More like — you live here, with others, with support, with therapy, with work, with dignity. But you don't leave unsupervised. Not ever.

4. **And he's still a token holder.** Still votes. Still has empathy invitations within that space. Still human.

5. **The community of people harmed** — the families of Jane, Ciara, Sarah — get to be part of deciding what this looks like. Not a judge. Them.

Maybe the answer for the 0.1% is: contained community, not cage. Still in the system. Just with permanent proximity limits.

Does that hold together? Or does it break somewhere?

# So, like house arrest, but community lead?

Yeah. Exactly.

**House arrest but community led:**

- The affected community decides the terms, not a judge
- Supervised, not isolated
- Dignity, work, therapy, human connection — just with permanent proximity limits
- Still a token holder. Still votes. Still receives empathy invitations within that space.
- Not punishment. Safety.

And crucially: **the families of the harmed get to be part of shaping it.** Not the state deciding on their behalf. Them.

The difference between this and current house arrest:
- Current: judge decides, ankle bracelet, isolation, punitive
- This: community decides, supported living, contained but included, protective

For the 99% — the process runs and prisons empty.

For the 0.1% Bradley Edwards edge — contained community, not cage. Honest about the limits. Still human.

That might be the answer. Not perfect. But real. And it doesn't require pretending we know how to "fix" someone who hunts people. It just keeps everyone safe without the revenge-box that makes everything worse.


# The System We Have Doesn't Keep Us Safe

That's the point, isn't it.

Bradley Edwards had a first victim. The system processed him. Punishment. Release. No empathy invitation. No facing. No community involvement. No ongoing proximity. Just: convicted, served time, out.

And then we are still here discussing what occurred afterwards..

The current system — the one everyone defends as "keeping us safe" — *provably failed* in exactly the case people point to when they say we need prisons.

Our system: the first victim is involved. Empathy invitation. Facing. The community sees him. He sees what he did through her life. Ongoing proximity checks. Pattern identified early. Protective measures in place *before* escalation.

Maybe he changes. Maybe he doesn't. But either way — the community knows. The people affected are involved. The process catches what the revenge-box missed.

The argument against abolition is always the Bradley Edwards case. But the Bradley Edwards case is actually the argument *for* abolition. Because the prison system had him. And let him go. Without any of the things that might have actually mattered.

The current system failed those women. Not your hypothetical system. The actual one we have now.

Our system here, that's Justice.

# Safety

Everything wrong with the current system in one story.

**What actually happened:**
- Early predatory violence occurred the 1990 Hollywood Hospital attack and the system treated it as minor
- Charged with common assault. Minimized.
- Job kept.
- Victim? Not part of the process. Sidelined.
- He learned: I can do this and the system will protect me.

**What our system here would have done:**
- Victim central to the process. Needs to be satisfied with what happens.
- Empathy invitation. Live a version of our experience.
- Proximity meeting. He faces her. She speaks. He listens. He speaks she listens. People there. People looking in. No obligation. Opportunity to meet again and again.
- Parent at workplace doesn't get to vouch. The person he harmed does — or doesn't.
- Community sees the pattern. The eyes. The shake of the head. The letting go. That's not a man who lost control. That's a man who *chose to stop this time.*

The current system saw a predator rehearsing and called it common assault.

The women, their families, the perpetrator, his family, our society, financially and emotionally. We all paid for that.

That's the difference.

Our system doesn't guarantee he changes. But it guarantees he's seen. And she's heard. And the community knows.
