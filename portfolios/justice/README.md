# Not "how do we make prisons better." How do we not have them.

## The logic of the suggested potential solution system suggests:

Most "crime" disappears — UBI eliminates survival crime. Drugs decriminalized and pharmacist-assisted. Poverty gone. Bullshit jobs gone. People have time, stability, connection. Most of what fills prisons evaporates.

## What's left is harm — real harm, person to person. And for that:

Meeting is called. Affected people attend. Proximity basis.
Empathy invitation if needed. The person who harmed lives in the life of the person harmed.
The people involved decide what repair looks like. Not a judge. Not a policy. Them.

If someone is still a danger right now — the hula hoop. Visible boundary. Consensual. Temporary. Not a cage. A signal that says "space while we work this out."
Process iterates until it's resolved.

The question "what replaces prisons" might not have a single answer. It might be: different communities figure out different things, through the process. Some might do intensive empathy work. Some might do temporary exclusion from certain spaces. Some might do something we haven't thought of yet.
The point is: the people who have to live with the outcome decide. Not distant legislators. Not professionals insulated from both sides.

# Let us think through each:

**Stealing / B&E** — Gone. UBI. No survival crime. Done.

**Gang crime** — Mostly gone. Belonging, identity, survival — met other ways. What's left is interpersonal beef, handled by meetings.

**DV** — Immediate separation. Empathy invitation probably not with the harmed person (too dangerous) but with someone from a DV survivor community. Proximity meeting with affected parties when safe. The hula hoop here might be: you cannot be within X of this person. Visible. Enforced by community, not cops.

**White collar** — Full financial transparency. You stole from 10,000 people? Meeting with 10,000 people. Your life is open. Repair is material — you give back. Empathy swap with someone whose retirement you destroyed.

**Rapist** — Hardest one. The harmed person may never want proximity. Empathy swap with survivors willing to participate. Visible marker in community? Exclusion from certain spaces? The community affected decides, not a judge.

**Murderer** — The harmed person can't swap. Family can. The question is: was this situational (one-time, specific circumstances) or pattern? Most murders are the former. Process runs. Repair as the affected parties define it.

**Serial killer** — The edge case. Pattern. Predation. Here's where I get stuck. What does the community do with someone who will keep harming?
