# Health: The Policy Failures

## The Question Nobody Asks

Why is the cheapest dinner in Australia a Happy Meal?

Why does ice cream — marketed to children — contain ingredients linked to cancer, ADHD, and metabolic disease?

Why is bacon in the same cancer classification as cigarettes, but cigarettes have warning labels and bacon has... recipe suggestions?

Why is the leading cause of death in Australia (heart disease) directly linked to diet, and yet we subsidise the industries that cause it?

**Because we don't vote on it.**

Politicians funded by food lobbies vote on it. And they vote for profit, not health.

## The Numbers

### What Kills Australians

| Cause of Death | Annual Deaths (approx) | Preventable? |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Heart disease | 18,000+ | Largely yes |
| Dementia/Alzheimer's | 15,000+ | Partially |
| Stroke | 8,500+ | Largely yes |
| Lung cancer | 8,500+ | Largely yes |
| Diabetes complications | 4,800+ | Largely yes |
| Colorectal cancer | 5,300+ | Partially |

**Source:** Australian Bureau of Statistics, Causes of Death 2022

Most of these are lifestyle-related. Diet, exercise, stress, sleep, connection. Things the current system makes harder, not easier.

### What We Spend

- **Healthcare:** $220+ billion/year (2022-23)
- **Preventative health:** ~2% of health budget

For every $1.40 invested in prevention, we save $13 in treatment costs.

But we don't invest in prevention. Because sick people are profitable.

## Bacon and Cigarettes: Same Classification, Different Treatment

The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies processed meat as **Group 1 carcinogen** — the same category as:

- Tobacco smoking
- Asbestos
- Plutonium

> "Processed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer."
>
> — IARC/WHO, 2015

**Group 1 means:** "There is sufficient evidence that it causes cancer in humans."

Not "might cause." Not "associated with." **Causes.**

### The Response

**Cigarettes:**
- Graphic health warnings covering 75% of packaging
- Advertising banned
- Plain packaging mandated
- Taxes increased repeatedly
- Smoking rates dropped from 24% (1991) to 11% (2022)

**Processed meat:**
- No warning labels
- Advertised freely, including to children
- Promoted as "part of a balanced diet"
- No additional taxation
- Consumption remains high

**Why the difference?**

Cigarettes: decades of public health campaigning, lawsuits, political will.

Processed meat: powerful agricultural lobby, cultural resistance, no political will.

If we voted on it directly — if the people whose lives are at stake decided — would we still allow Group 1 carcinogens to be marketed to children without warning labels?

## McDonald's: 2.5 Million Happy Meals Per Day

McDonald's sells approximately **2.5 million Happy Meals per day** in the US alone. Scale that globally.

A Happy Meal is often the cheapest dinner option for a family. That's not an accident. That's policy.

### Why Is Poison Cheaper Than Vegetables?

1. **Agricultural subsidies:** Corn, soy, and wheat (used in processed food) receive massive government subsidies. Vegetables receive almost none.

2. **Economies of scale:** Industrial food production is optimised for shelf-stable, transportable, processed products — not fresh food.

3. **Externalised costs:** The health costs of processed food are paid by individuals and the healthcare system, not by the companies that profit.

4. **Marketing budgets:** McDonald's marketing budget: ~$2 billion/year globally. Broccoli's marketing budget: $0.

**Result:** A burger costs less than a salad. Feeding your kids poison is cheaper than feeding them health.

### What's In That Ice Cream?

Common ingredients in commercial ice cream marketed to children:

| Ingredient | Concerns |
|------------|----------|
| High fructose corn syrup | Metabolic syndrome, obesity, fatty liver |
| Carrageenan | Inflammation, digestive issues |
| Artificial colours (e.g., Red 40, Yellow 5) | Linked to hyperactivity in children, potential carcinogen |
| Polysorbate 80 | Gut inflammation, microbiome disruption |
| Artificial flavours | Poorly regulated, unknown long-term effects |
| Palm oil | Cardiovascular concerns, environmental destruction |

These are fed to children daily. With cartoon characters on the packaging.

If you gave your child a substance linked to hyperactivity and cancer, you'd be investigated. If a corporation does it with a cartoon mascot, it's "breakfast."

## The Regulatory Capture

### Who Decides What's Safe?

Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) sets food safety standards. Their board and advisory committees include representatives from:

- Food industry
- Agricultural industry
- Manufacturing industry

The people profiting from the current system decide what's "safe" in the current system.

### Who Funds the Research?

Much nutritional research is funded by food companies. Studies funded by industry are **7-8 times more likely** to show favourable results for the sponsor.

> "Financial ties to the food industry may bias the conclusions of scientific research."
>
> — PLOS Medicine systematic review

The science isn't neutral. The policy isn't neutral. The outcomes aren't accidental.

## What Proximity-Weighted Voting Would Change

Imagine health policy decided by:

- People with heart disease (and their families)
- Parents of children with diet-related health issues
- Healthcare workers dealing with preventable disease daily
- Communities where fast food is the only affordable option

Not by:

- Food industry lobbyists
- Politicians receiving industry donations
- Bureaucrats rotating between regulator and industry jobs

### Likely Outcomes

**If affected people voted directly:**

1. **Warning labels on processed meat** — Same as cigarettes. Group 1 carcinogen gets Group 1 treatment.

2. **Subsidies redirected** — From corn/soy (processed food inputs) to vegetables and whole foods.

3. **Advertising restrictions** — No marketing junk food to children. Same as tobacco.

4. **Sugar tax** — Revenue directed to subsidising healthy food in low-income areas.

5. **Healthcare investment shift** — From treatment to prevention. From hospitals to community health.

6. **Fast food pricing** — True cost pricing that includes health externalities. Or subsidised healthy alternatives that undercut junk.

**None of this is radical.** Other countries do versions of it. We just don't, because the people harmed don't make the decisions.

## The Happy Meal Test

Here's a simple test for any governance system:

**Would this system allow the cheapest dinner option for struggling families to be a product that causes heart disease, obesity, and early death — while the companies profiting pay nothing for the health consequences?**

Current system: Yes.

Token system: No. Because the families eating Happy Meals would vote on food policy. And they wouldn't vote to poison their own children.

---

## The Slow Violence

We prosecute fast violence. Someone poisons a person, they go to prison.

We subsidise slow violence. A corporation poisons millions over decades, they get tax breaks.

> "Mushroom lady poisons her family — locked away for life. Business poisons us for profit — legal, encouraged, subsidised."

The only difference is speed. And who's profiting.

## The Connection

This isn't separate from the token system. It's why the token system matters.

**Current system:**
- Politicians funded by food industry
- Regulators staffed by food industry
- Research funded by food industry
- Policy written by food industry
- Cheapest food is the most harmful
- Health costs paid by individuals and public healthcare
- Industry profits, we die

**Token system:**
- Affected people vote on policy
- Proximity to harm = voting weight
- No lobbying (no politicians to lobby)
- Direct democracy on health matters
- People who eat the food decide what's in it
- People who pay health costs decide health policy

The token system doesn't guarantee perfect health policy. But it guarantees the people harmed by bad policy get to change it.

That's all we need. The rest follows.

## The Ant Principle

A Bug's Life. Every kid has seen it.

The grasshoppers take everything. The ants work themselves to death. The ants vastly outnumber the grasshoppers. But the grasshoppers keep winning.

Why?

**Because the ants haven't decided together to stop them.**

The moment they do — the moment they coordinate and say "no" at the same time — it's over. Instantly. The grasshoppers have no power except the ants' belief that they're powerless.

That's us. Right now.

There are more of us than there are of them. The food industry executives, the politicians they fund, the regulators they capture — they're the grasshoppers. We're the ants.

The poison food, the prisons, the bullshit jobs, the 1 in 6 kids in poverty while we sit on $19 trillion — **all of it survives only because we haven't coordinated a collective "no."**

We could solve it in 3 seconds. Literally. By making one decision, all at once.

**The token system is the coordination mechanism.**

One token per human. Everyone votes. Proximity-weighted so the affected decide. No politicians to lobby. No corporations to capture. Just us, deciding together.

That's all it takes. The ants deciding together.

3 seconds. One decision. Done.

## The Ant Principle

A Bug's Life. Every kid has seen it. Every kid understood it.

**There are more of us than there are of them.**

The grasshoppers only win because the ants haven't decided together to stop them. The moment they do — it's over. Instantly. Not a battle. Just... done.

That's us. Right now.

The food industry. The politicians. The lobbyists. The billionaires. The whole apparatus that poisons children for profit.

**There are more of us than there are of them.**

They survive because we haven't coordinated. Because we each feel alone. Because we think "what can one person do?"

Nothing. One person can do nothing.

**All of us, deciding at once, can do everything.**

The token system isn't a policy proposal. It isn't a petition. It isn't "raising awareness."

It's the coordination mechanism for the moment we all decide together.

One token per human. Everyone votes. Proximity-weighted so the affected decide. No politicians to lobby. No corporations to bribe. Just us.

3 seconds. One decision. We're done.

The grasshoppers go hungry.

## What You Can Do Now

Not "read labels." Not "cook more." Not "write to your representative."

We already know that doesn't work. Decades of health advice. Decades of "awareness campaigns." Decades of "making better choices." And heart disease is still the #1 killer. Kids are still eating poison. The cheapest dinner is still a Happy Meal.

**Individual action within a broken system is not a solution. It's a pressure release valve that lets the system continue.**

So what do you actually do?

### Wake Up

You know now. You've read this. You can't unknow it.

The system that governs your food, your health, your life — it's designed to extract profit from your body until you die. That's not conspiracy. That's the documented, cited, peer-reviewed reality.

### Dedicate Yourself

This isn't a hobby. This isn't a weekend project. This is the machinery that determines whether children get cancer.

If you have skills — coding, organising, writing, anything — use them for this. Not for another app. Not for another startup. For this.

### Build It

- Get a token
- Start voting
- Learn to code if you can't
- Find others who see it
- Make it happen

The technical specs exist. The philosophy exists. The evidence exists. What's missing is people who will build it.

### No More Excuses

You know now. You have the means. Therefore you have the duty.

If after reading this you do nothing — if you go back to your life and "hope things get better" — you are complicit.

You are causing people cancer.
You are feeding kids poison.
You are the mushroom lady, just slower.

The only difference between you and someone who deliberately poisons children is that you're doing it through inaction instead of action. The kids are just as sick either way.

**There is no neutral position.**

You either join a system that fixes this, or you create a system that fixes this. Or you continue to cause it and should be imprisoned according to your own law.

Choose.
